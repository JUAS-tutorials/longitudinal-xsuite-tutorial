# JUAS longitudinal beam dynamics simulation

## Introduction

This repository contains the JUAS longitudinal beam dynamics tutorial notebooks.

## Installation

Follow first the installation instructions detailed in the [dedicated repository](https://github.com/JUAS-tutorials/xsuite-installation).
This repository can be cloned using git `git clone https://github.com/JUAS-tutorials/longitudinal-xsuite-tutorial.git` or the repository content can be downloaded directly via [this link](https://github.com/JUAS-tutorials/longitudinal-xsuite-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Content of the notebooks

### 1. Getting started

Check that the longitudinal tracking is working, below and above transition energy.

### 2. Phase Mismatch

Add an injection error in the form of a phase mismatch and study the effect on the beam.

### 3. Voltage Mismatch

Increase the RF voltage and study the effect on the beam.

### 4. Acceleration

Study how the beam evolves during acceleration and transition crossing.
